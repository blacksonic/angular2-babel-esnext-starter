<h3>
What are Routes?</h3>
<p>
Routes are way to access various parts of website using friendly urls. For example if you have a motorcycle store - it will be very convenient if you can navigate to details of page of awesome <a href="http://www.suzukicycles.com/Product%20Lines/Cycles/Products/GSX-S1000/2016/GSXS1000A.aspx">suzuki GSX1000</a>

 using url 
like:
 <br />
<span style="color: blue;">mybikestore.com/suzuki/GSX1000 </span><br />
<br />
(instead of using things like: 
<br />
<span style="color: blue;">mybikestore.com?product=%20%dfgg;ereGSX1000%dfg</span><br />
which you have no chance to remember)
<br />
This way the url pretty clear for users and makes much more sense for developers too.<br />
cannot stop myself from putting here picture of GSX1000 2016<br />

<h3>
Routes in Angular2</h3>
Since when talking about <a href="https://angular.io/">angularjs2</a> we talking about single page application architecture there all the work done by javascript. The routes in angular (both 1. and 2) is the way to load different views (like different pages) of the website. The changes in url triggering javascript event and javascript responds by loading corresponding views, pretty cool isnt it?
</p>
<p>
<h3>
Server</h3>
Speaking about single page application - the idea of single page app is that only one page should be served from the server - so it need to  be specially configured. <br />
Here is configuration of nodejs <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express</a> server which makes it to serve only index page no matter of what route was chosen.
<br />
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
app.use(express.static(__dirname));

app.get('/*', function(req, res){
    res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
});
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, function () {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');
});

</code>
</pre>
<br />
</p>

<h3>
Routes in angular2</h3>
<p>
To implement routes in angular2 'angular2/router' module must be included
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
import {ROUTER_PROVIDERS, APP_BASE_HREF} from 'angular2/router';
</code>
</pre>
Also, in the code of main component must present <strong>route definitions</strong> part - a code which defines the routes and their urls:
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
@Routes([
  {
    path: '/',
    component: DashboardComponent
  },
  {
    path: '/reports',
    component: ReportsComponent
  }
])
</code>
</pre>
Notice that in this example we have two views: "Dashboard" and "Reports"

</p>


<h3>
View</h3>
<p>Like in angular1 - if you want to load routed views in your application you must use the ROUTER DIRECTIVE in the view of the component
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
import {Component} from 'angular2/core';
import {ROUTER_DIRECTIVES, Router, Route, RouteConfig} from 'angular2/router';
...

@Component({
  selector: 'app',
  template: `
    ...
    &lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;
  `,
  directives: [ROUTER_DIRECTIVES]
})
</code>
</pre>
